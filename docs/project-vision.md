# Pixel Creator Project Vision

## What is Pixel Creator?

Pixel Creator is a **web-first, beginner-friendly multiplayer game creation platform**.

It is not designed to compete with Unity or Unreal, nor to satisfy engine hackers. It exists to solve a very specific problem:

> Making online multiplayer game creation accessible to people who do not want to become programmers or server engineers.

The project deliberately favors **clarity over power**, **determinism over randomness**, and **approachability over flexibility**.

## Core Philosophy

Pixel Creator is opinionated by design:
- Beginner-first
- Multiplayer-first
- Web-first

Complexity is a cost. If complexity does not directly benefit end users, it must be removed.

The engine must:
- Hide networking concerns entirely
- Encourage experimentation and learning
- Remain understandable when inspected
- Behave predictably at runtime

---

## Target Audience

Pixel Creator is designed for:
- Beginners with no programming background
- Indie creators who want multiplayer without server setup
- Small remote teams collaborating in real time
- Developers who value simplicity and clarity

Pixel Creator is **not** designed for:
- AAA production pipelines
- Low-level engine modification
- Highly abstract or meta-programming workflows

---

## Long-Term Vision

Pixel Creator aims to become:
- A living ecosystem for multiplayer game creation
- A collaborative online editor
- A distribution platform for community games
- A marketplace for modules and assets

The engine is expected to evolve slowly and carefully, based on real-world usage rather than theoretical completeness.

## Product Values

- Accessibility over raw power
- Determinism over randomness
- Explicit behavior over implicit magic
- Stability over feature count

If a feature compromises these values, it must be reconsidered.
