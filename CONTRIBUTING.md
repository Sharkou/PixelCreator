# Contributing to Pixel Creator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Pixel Creator**! We welcome contributions from developers, artists, and other creatives. This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively and responsibly.

**Note:** Pixel Creator uses a hybrid open source model.

## Code Contributions

You are welcome to:

- Submit bug fixes  
- Suggest or implement enhancements in the editor  
- Improve documentation or examples

**Important:**  
All code contributions must target the **`sandbox` branch**.

- `sandbox` is used for development, testing, and experimentation  
- `main` is reserved for stable releases and is maintained by the project owner  

Pull Requests targeting `main` directly will be closed or redirected to `sandbox`.

## How to Contribute (Pull Request workflow)

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a request to merge your changes into the project.

### Step-by-step

1. **Fork the repository**  
   https://github.com/Sharkou/PixelCreator

2. **Create a branch from `sandbox`**:

   ```bash
   git checkout sandbox
   git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature
   ```
3. Make your changes with clear, concise commits:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"
   ```
4. Push your branch and open a Pull Request (PR).

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/awesome-feature
   ```
Include a clear description of your changes and why they are useful.

5. Open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub:
- Base branch: sandbox
- Compare branch: your feature branch
- Clearly explain what you changed and why

Tip: Smaller, focused PRs are easier to review and more likely to be merged quickly.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or unexpected behavior:
- Check existing issues first
- If none match, open a new issue with:\
     - A clear description of the problem
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Screenshots or examples if applicable
 
## Feature Requests

We love ideas! To suggest a new feature:
- Open an issue with the label `enhancement`
- Include the problem you want to solve, your proposed solution, and any references
- Keep requests realistic to the scope of the project

## Assets & Marketplace Contributions

Pixel Creator allows creators to submit assets (sprites, sounds, templates) for the official marketplace:
- Ensure you own the rights to your submissions
- Provide clear previews and descriptions
- High-quality contributions are more likely to be featured

## Code of Conduct

We aim to maintain a friendly and inclusive community. Please:
- Be respectful in discussions
- Avoid spam or self-promotion unrelated to Pixel Creator
- Follow GitHub guidelines and use constructive feedback

Anyone violating the code of conduct may have their contributions or access revoked.
